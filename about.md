Hey, I'm Tony and congrats on finding my website/coding blog... thing. As you can probably tell, the site is still in its preliminary stages, so I want to assure you that I'm still working on the general UI and updating the entries... promise. 

Until then, please enjoy the following section where I give a riveting 3 line summary of what exactly I do on this website: 

I enjoy experimenting, tinkering if you will, with things that I deem as interesting at the time and I'll
post the product here if it isn't a complete disaster. I'm most familiar with Java but I've been recently working with Javascript and HTML/CSS so the new projects posted here will most likely be of that genre.

If you have any ideas, comments, concerns, or cat stories that you would like me to hear, you can email me at: tinkerertony@gmail.com

Tony
