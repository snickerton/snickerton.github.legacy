Sup, I'm Tony and if you're reading this it either means you're an extremely good friend of mine
or you're horribly lost on the internet because this site is still under construction. 

I enjoy experimenting, tinkering if you will, with things that I deem as interesting at the time and I'll
post the product here if it isn't a failure. I'm most familiar with Java but I've been recently working with Javascript and HTML/CSS so the new projects posted here will most likely be of that genre.

If you have any ideas, comments, concerns, or cat stories that you would like me to hear, you can email me at: tinkerertony@gmail.com
