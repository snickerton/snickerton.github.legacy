<h3><b>What it is:</b></h3>
It is the best celebratory website to send to your friend when they lose their virginity.

<b>Site:</b> [http://snickerton.github.io/HeyHaeyeon/][site]

<b>Duration Coding:</b> 2hrs

<h3><b>Process:</b></h3>
Recently, my good coding buddy came onto a skype call with me and the words "I just had sex". Naturally, after a string of really bad jokes and dumbfounded amazement from me, I thought of an appropriate way to celebrate the occasion. With the knowledge that this friend, let's call him Nosaj Now, had previously worked with animations in html, I decided that it would be extremely possible, with his help, to whip up a surprise party-esque pandora's sex box of wonder. Overall it probably took longer to debug the forgotten semicolons in the stylsheet or to edit a transparent background into the clipart balloons found online. Once all the assets were found and a single animations worked, you could just copy paste it's css and tinker until you got your desired animations for the other "party objects".  

With all of this being said, I must give credit where it's due. Unfortunately, I generally believe these types of things should be discreet/private for obvious reasons. In leu of that, I'll just simply say: Congrats to Nosaj Now for losing his virginity in the most boss way possible, and thanks to him for inspiring this wonderful piece of art.

....Oh yeah, you can find his completely anonymous and discreet website (and url) here: <http://jaswon5791.github.io/>


<h3><b>Lesson Learned:</b></h3>
Animations in html are pretty powerful and fast, however it still sucks not to have a compiler to tell you what errors you have in your css stylesheet.

<h3><b>Future:</b></h3>
Hopefully one day, I'll be able to open this website and smile because it would finally apply to me.
