<h3><b>What it is:</b></h3>


<b>Site:</b> [snickerton.github.io/Math420MovementModel][site]

<b>Duration Coding:</b> An entire night so.... 6 hours..ish?

<h3><b>Process:</b></h3>
So yeah wow hey we're back once again, coding through the night like the good ol' times. I'm sure all of my 2 followers are glad to hear that I'm not dead and that they can't wait to tell me how much they've missed me during my extended hiatus. However, before we do all of that I just wanted to note how great it is to be back on campus and how wonderful and supportive everyone's been since I've gotten here. Mushy gushy feelings aside though, let's dive right into it.

It started out has a discussion in class about how nice it would be to visually see and understand a certain math problem our class was having trouble with. This quickly evolved into a "yeah sure I totally have lots of time I can whip that up tonight and have it by tomorrow for the class" towards my teacher who, needless to say, was ecstatic about it.
