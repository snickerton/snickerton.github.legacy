<h3><b>What it is:</b></h3> 
I once read the insult "you cunt muffin" on a website for judging whether or not to punish toxics League of Legends players based off of their chat logs. After recovering from my hurting sides and cheeks, I decided I could make an insult generator that took a nsfw noun and combined it with a random household noun. The result was pretty amazing.

<b>Site:</b> [snickerton.github.io/insultsGalore][site] 

<b>Duration Coding:</b> 1hr

<h3><b>Process:</b></h3> 
You have an array full of words that could get you slapped by your mother, and you have an array full harmless everyday objects. Get a random number generator and find the string at that index position in both arrays, slap 'em together and you got yourself an insult.

<h3><b>Lesson Learned:</b></h3>
I'm easily amused.

<h3><b>Future:</b></h3> 
1) Forget about the existence of this website. 

2) Stumble upon it again when looking through my old projects.

3) Enjoy a good chuckle or two.

4) Profit.



<strong><b>UPDATE [3-22-15]:</b></strong> Try opening this website on Chrome and make sure your volume is up. Oh what a wonderful age we live in.
